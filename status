just a guideline to show the status of the job in trial to ease work on a relational database model.
uploaded: Status to mean that the job has been uploaded to the database
Completed: Shows that the job has been done and awaiting verification from the admin
assigned: Means the job has been assigned to someone to do.
adminpoor: Means admin has verifies the job as poorly done and passes the job back to the guy to redo it.
admingood: Means admin verifies the job as well done and passes it to  owner

Pages required for the application to hold completely
index page: Landing page for the application when url is clicked as well as redirection position during access of             resources that need authentication.
login page: Requires a simple form template that users use to login to their portals
signup page:Going to be quite huge since writers need to prove they can writes and this time round writers are also getting accounts and a normal portal for all users, just different access to resources.

jobs according to their status's
uploaded: All jobs uploaded to the database
completed: jobs completed by the writers
assigned: jobs assigned to writers to handle them
adminpoor: Admin rating badly of jobs done by the users
admingood: Means admin isnt satisfied with job already done
notsatisfied: Means client not satisfied with how the job has been done and requires that it is reapeated
satisfied: Means client is satisfied with the work and can go home happy.

divide status into two
  one where the status defines the stand of the admin to the job given... I just need to document it for better follow up of whatever happens within the app
  Second status will go to whatever is really happening within the job... Coz both admin and client need to see what is really going down with the jobs
  And next time i come around i'll be ready with the two status message... They sure do need documentation.
  satisfied: Means client is satisfied with the work and can go home happy.
